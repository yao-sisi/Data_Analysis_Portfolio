Founded in 2015, Olist is a Brazilian B2B ECommerce marketplace that is leading the way as the no.1 commerce enabler for SMBs in Brazil (Crunchbase). Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to merchants with a single contract, those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners.

In this analysis, I take on the role of a data analytics consultant hired by Olist. With anonymized data from Olist (Kaggle), I provide actionable insights that help Olist improve its processes. 
This analysis is done in three parts based on Olist's business model (and available data):
​
Buyer Experience
As a two-sided marketplace, Olist's business model is based on bringing buyers and sellers together, the business thrives when the two sides transact. As Josh Bereinlinger, a venture capitalist from Sigma West once said: "It's easy to find people that want to make money, it's much harder to find people that want to spend money.", providing a seamless user experience to the demand side (buyers) is crucial to Olist. Two important aspects of a pleasant buyer experience are product satisfaction and delivery satisfaction. ​
Sales Transactions
Olist's top line is closely related to the gross transaction value, it is crucial that the team identifies and monitors its top earning categories, and prioritizes meeting the expectations of buyers in those areas. 
Marketing Funnels (Sellers)
The marketing funnel's focus should be on bringing in more sellers in the top earning categories at the lowest acquisition cost (labour for example).

This is a project that I am currently working on, the analysis will consist of a data analysis in Python and a Tableau dashboard (work in progress) for the company to monitor its KPIs.
