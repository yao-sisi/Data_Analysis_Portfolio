# Data Analytics Portfolio - Sisi Yao

Hello there üëãüèº, I am Sisi.

I come from a business background and hold a Bachelor's of Commerce degree in Accountancy. I found the data field by chance (through Google Sheets queries, which led me to learn SQL) while working for a media company where I have access to a lot of social media data and just couldn't get it off my mind.

One Udemy course led to another, before I knew it I was 90% done with the Data Scientist with Python career track on DataCamp (all the while simoutaneously doing my own analysis on datasets I found interesting, with the various tools I picked up along the way). The decision to pivot into a data analytics career just happened to me.

This repository therefore, not only serves as my data analyst portfolio, but also documents my data analytics journey. 

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio :)

The objective of this analysis is to identify high value customers/churn risks and improve customer retention. The analysis began with slicing and dicing the data in MySQL. Once I got more familiar with the data, I connected it to Tableau in order to visualize my findings and create a story.

In this analysis, I played the role of a business analyst/data analyst to Airbnb Montreal and analyzed the data available on Inside Airbnb in order to make recommendations on how Airbnb can maximize its revenue in Montreal. I performed the EDA in SQL and moved onto Tableau to present my findings.

Unicorn (companies) is a term commonly used in venture capital to describe privately held startups whose valuation exceeds one billion. In this analysis, I take a look at the current landscape of unicorn companies, some of the questions that inspired this analysis were: 1). Which industries are getting the biggest piece of the pie (in terms of capital)? 2). Are there any trends over time? 3). Which countries are the leaders in ‚Äúunicorn production‚Äù? 4). Who are the biggest investors?


## Micro and Hobby Projects

As a non-American who follows marketing and ad-tech news regularly, every year around Super Bowl time, I start to see news about Super Bowl commercials and their astronomical price tags, and I have always had this question in my mind ‚Äî why are advertisers so eager to spend millions to place an ad at Super Bowl, especially with the social media bloom and ever-changing advertising landscape? In this analysis, I try to find out 1). Are the price tags of Superbowl ads justified? 2). How can advertisers make the most out of their spend?


## Coding Challenges

I love solving coding questions from big tech companies as a way to test my skills and I do not pick the easy ones ;)
