Hello there 👋🏼, I am Sisi.

I come from a business background and hold a Bachelor's of Commerce degree in Accountancy. I found the data field by chance (through Google Sheets queries, which led me to learn SQL) while working for a media company where I have access to a lot of social media data and just couldn't get it off my mind.

One Udemy course led to another, before I knew it I was 90% done with the Data Scientist with Python career track on DataCamp (all the while simoutaneously doing my own analysis on datasets I found interesting, with the various tools I picked up along the way). The decision to pivot into a data analytics career seemed to just happened to me.

This repository therefor, not only serves as my data analyst portfolio, but also documents my data analytics journey. 

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio :)
